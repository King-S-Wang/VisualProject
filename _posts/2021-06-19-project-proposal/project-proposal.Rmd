# Title:

plans on mini challenges to do  

## Motivation and Objective 


## Tasks and analysis  
### Mini challenge 1 - XZ  
what is the approach, tasks to perform, any challenge to expect, what are the expected outputs, story to tell  

### Mini challenge 2 - maybe    
what is the approach, tasks to perform, any challenge to expect, what are the expected outputs, story to tell  

### Mini challange 3 - Lu Di  
#### **Task to performance**:  
On January 23, 2014, multiple events unfolded in Abila. We are perform a retrospective analysis based on limited information about what took place.My goal is to identify risks and find way how to mitigated the risk more effectively.

Base on the data provided, we will evaluate the changing levels of risk to the public and find effective action to avoid things that endanger public safety.

#### **Data Source**:  
Challenge 3 provide two kind of texts. One is **Microblog** which  have been identified by automated filters as being potentially relevant to the ongoing incident. The other is **Text transcripts** of emergency dispatches by the Abila, Kronos local police and fire departments.

#### **Tools will be used**:  
R has a rich set of packages for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and generating plots.In challenge 3 we may use the R packages below  to achieve different functions.  

**tm**: Text mining operations like removing numbers, special characters, punctuation and stop words.  

**snowballc**: For stem the word to reducing words to their base or root form.  

**wordcloud**ï¼šFor generating the word cloud plot.  

**syuzhet**: For sentiment scores and emotion classification  

**ggplot**: To visualize our analyze result by all kinds of plot.

#### **Expected Outputs**: 
According the text analysis and visualization result on **Microblog** and **Text transcripts** in On January 23, 2014 17:00 to 21:31 to find what's risk have high probability to happen in the future days in Abila, Kronos and figure out effective action to stop such risk from happening.
